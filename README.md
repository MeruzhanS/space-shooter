# space-shooter
A space shooter game I created from scratch using a game canvas and constantly updating based on game time.

In this project, I learned js and the p5.js library. I learned to interact with the p5 game creation tool
  in a way that fits my needs.
  
Since p5.js creates games by having constant updates, managing the update spped and it's effects was quite a challenge.
